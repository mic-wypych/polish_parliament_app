# Polish parliament app

This is an application showing all members of Polish Sejm (lower chamber of Parliament) with corresponding information like party affiliation, district, number of votes etc.

## TODO

- add a table with all MPs that allow to sort/filter e.g. for most active MPs

- add a separate tab with party level info
  - parties, logos, number of members
  - committees and members
  - party votes/legislation?

- add a separate tab with vote level info
  - recent votes and how each MP voted?
  - vote level info - date, description, how many yes, no whether it passed
